# Advanced CSS Project

## Overview
This project is an advanced HTML & CSS challenge, building upon the previous HTML basics project. The focus here is on **styling, layout, and responsive design**, transforming a simple HTML structure into a visually appealing, professional webpage.

The design reference is provided on Figma, including fonts, colors, spacing, and images.

## Project Objectives
- Apply advanced CSS techniques to enhance the visual appearance of the website.
- Implement responsive design principles for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.
- Use semantic HTML elements consistently (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`).
- Style all major elements: navigation, content sections, tables, forms, and footer.
- Incorporate logos, icons, and other design assets provided in Figma.
- Ensure accessibility and good user experience across devices.
